                        <p> I am an established freelance developer in Mukah, Sarawak. My main points
                            of focus are in Web and Mobile Apps, with a specific focus in React and
                            Android. Speed and efficiency are what I focus on when creating a project. It
                            needs to be simple, work properly, and get done in timely manor that doesn't
                            break the bank. I have experience with other frameworks as well including
                            Vue, PHP and Flutter (experimental Android / iOS language). Most of my
                            previous projects have used Amazon Web Services, Firebase or MongoDB. I
                            have a special interest in creating databases and REST api's in either MySQL
                            or NoSQL. Feel free to contact with any questions to.</p>
